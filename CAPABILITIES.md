â†’ Creates quiz with title, due date, points, and course assignment
```

```
"Make an assignment for chapter 3 homework in course 12345"
â†’ Creates assignment with extracted title and course ID
```

```
"Upload the syllabus.pdf file to my English course"
â†’ Uploads file to correct course based on context
```

### Advanced Parsing Features
- **Flexible date parsing**: "tomorrow", "next Monday", "in 2 weeks", "December 15th at 11:59 PM"
- **Point value extraction**: "worth 50 points", "25 pts", "100 point assignment"
- **Course identification**: Course names, IDs, or contextual references
- **Content type detection**: Automatically distinguishes quizzes, assignments, pages, etc.
- **Multi-step operations**: "Create a quiz and add it to module 3"

## ðŸ“‹ Example Use Cases

### Daily Teaching Tasks
- **Quick content creation**: "Make a page about today's lab procedures"
- **Assignment management**: "Create homework 5 due next Wednesday worth 30 points"
